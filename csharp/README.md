# C# Implementation
This is a .NET Core implementation of some classic algorithms and data structures.

We've decided to not use any packages and stick to C# features that are baked in the framework itself. Not even a test framework is being used, but a console application that runs and do all validations. Not to say that we are refraining from using advanced C# features such as generics, extension methods, and others. 

### Requirements:
  1. .NET Core >= 2.1

## List of structures and algorithms

### Sorting / searching

* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
